Initial Execution Plan
Scope/Objectives
•	Problem: Finding who is on campus, where the individual is located, what people are doing, and how busy rooms are.
•	Use case: Cornell Tech students walk into campus, sees a board broadcasting location information of people that have ‘check-in’. User that has app broadcasts to display board that user is checking and where the location of other users are on campus.
Meeting Time
•	Recurring meeting with Team mentor: Every Tuesday, 4 – 4:30pm
•	Recurring meeting with Faculty Advisor: Every other week with Mor (To be scheduled)
Deliverables
•	Working Android application 
•	Backend-server
•	Front-end display on the big board
•	Technical/functional documentation explaining key aspects of the app (for others to support/enhance)
•	Pitch/final presentation
Work plan / Milestones
•	Sept.
o	Talk to XX number of students to validate problem / ideate potential solution
•	Oct.
o	Develop functional back-end
o	Wireframe/prototype UI for mobile app and display
•	Nov.
o	Develop working app prototype including back-end
o	Draft technical documentation and pitch desk
•	Dec.
o	Create version 1 / MVP
o	Pitch presentation
Success Metric
•	75% of app downloads by Cornell Tech students and faculty with Android phones
•	# of check-ins and usage information
•	Student survey post launch, that they have an easier time finding people on campus
Risk
•	Technical: Ability for app to accurately report location of user when multiple beacon signals are received -> Mitigation: Putting this question on the build-board and seek help, Seeking advice from mentors
•	Technical: Ability to build application and back-end server to support functionality -> Mitigation: MS students are taking an Android class “Building Startup Systems” that have some technical overlap.
•	General: Are we solving the right student problem? -> Mitigation: We’ll interview Cornell Tech students regarding the issue to get ‘voice of customer’
•	Scheduling: Given vastly varying class schedules, will the project we delayed? -> Mitigation: We’re planning to share calendars so we can see what potential conflicts are, we plan to also lock down a time to work together.
•	Physical permission: Do we have permission to install beacons in the classroom? -> We’re going to ask Mor to confirm this is acceptable.
